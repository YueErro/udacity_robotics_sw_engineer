### What is a Robot?
> A machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically especially one programmable by a computer

A robot is a machine designed by humans and can come in many different shapes and sizes.

Essential elements of robotics:
* Perception (sensors) --> sense
* Decision Making (analyzation of sensor measurements) --> think
* Action (actuators) --> act
